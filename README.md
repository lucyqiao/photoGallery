# photoGallery
Uses the Flickr API to create a web page where a user can search "flower" and the page will show a grid of 30 photo pulled from Flickr.
When a photo is clicked, the photo will be displayed in a lightbox view, with the ability to move to the next / previous photos and display the caption.
